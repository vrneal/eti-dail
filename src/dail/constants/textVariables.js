export const DAIL_DESCRIPTION = `
This database presents information about ongoing and completed litigation involving
artificial intelligence, including machine learning. It covers cases and published 
opinions at all stages of litigation. It is intended to be broad in scope, covering 
everything from algorithms used in hiring and credit and criminal sentencing decisions
to liability for accidents involving autonomous vehicles. It also includes some cases
concerning statistical analysis and data protection that may not directly involve
artificial intelligence, but that are of particular relevance to AI projects. It includes
cases addressing whether AIs can be authors of works protected by copyright law, or
inventors of inventions protected by patent law, but it does not include litigation
concerning patents that may involve artificial intelligence or machine learning.
